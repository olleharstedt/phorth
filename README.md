At a very conceptual stage.

The idea was to be able to benefit both from the Forth macro system and the huge PHP ecosystem.

Will probably code it in OCaml.

Stack docs would be mandatory.

The implicit stack should have configurable behaviour.

String interpolation should still work.

    "Something to show" echo

or

    ." Something to show with extra $content" echo

Hacks for `"`?
